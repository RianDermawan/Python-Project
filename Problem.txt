We should find the data whose: 
1. column 'RR' is more than 80
2. column 'ddd_x' is max?
My idea's is:
1. if column 'RR' <= 80 convert to NaN because if we direcly slicing with condition in column 'RR' > 80 then some data is missing. It won't count all data. 
Our goal is count the data even condition not satisfy. So, if condition not satisfy then we count for some data is 0.
